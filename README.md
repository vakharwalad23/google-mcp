# Google MCP Tools

[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@vakharwalad23/google-mcp)](https://smithery.ai/server/@vakharwalad23/google-mcp)

This is a collection of Google-native tools (e.g., Gmail, Calendar) for the [MCP protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.com/docs/mcp-protocol), designed to integrate seamlessly with AI clients like Claude or Cursor.

## OAuth Token Management

The server includes built-in OAuth token management to handle expired access tokens gracefully:

- **Automatic Token Refresh**: When access tokens expire, you can refresh them without going through the full OAuth flow again
- **Complete Re-authentication**: Automatically handle cases where refresh tokens are invalid or expired
- **Persistent Storage**: Refreshed tokens are automatically saved to your configured token file path
- **Session Continuity**: All Google services are re-initialized with fresh tokens after refresh

### Refreshing Tokens

If you encounter authentication errors or want to proactively refresh your tokens, simply ask:

```
Refresh my Google OAuth tokens
```

This will:

1. Use your stored refresh token to get new access tokens
2. Update the token file with the new credentials
3. Re-initialize all Google services with fresh authentication
4. Show you the new token expiration time

### Complete Re-authentication

If you get `invalid_grant` errors or your refresh token has expired, you can start fresh:

```
Re-authenticate my Google account
```

This automated process will:

1. **Delete existing tokens** from your token file
2. **Start OAuth server** to handle the callback
3. **Open browser** for fresh authentication
4. **Save new tokens** automatically
5. **Re-initialize services** with fresh credentials

You'll only need to click "Allow" in the browser - everything else is automated!

**Note**: If you don't have a valid refresh token, you'll need to go through the initial OAuth authentication flow again.

### Manual Installation

1. Prerequisites:

   - Install Bun:

   ```bash
   brew install oven-sh/bun/bun  # macOS/Linux with Homebrew
   ```

2. Set Up OAuth:

   - Create a Google Cloud project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Set up OAuth 2.0 credentials (Client ID, Client Secret).
   - Choose the type Desktop app.
   - If using test mode, add your email to the test users list.
   - Make sure to enable API access for desired services (Gmail, Calendar, Drive etc.).

3. Configure Your Client: Edit your claude_desktop_config.json (or equivalent config file for your client):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-mcp": {
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": ["--no-cache", "google-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        // Either can be used, but not both
        // Use OAuth
        "GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID": "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>",
        "GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET": "<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>",
        "GOOGLE_OAUTH_TOKEN_PATH": "<PATH_TO_STORE_TOKENS>",
        // Use Service Account
        "GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL": "<YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>",
        "GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY": "<YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY>",
        "GMAIL_USER_TO_IMPERSONATE": "<USER_TO_IMPERSONATE>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

4. Authenticate:
   - The first time you run the server, it will open a browser for OAuth authentication. Follow the prompts to grant access, and tokens will be saved to GOOGLE_OAUTH_TOKEN_PATH.

## Usage

Now, ask Claude to use the `google-mcp` tool.

```
Send an email to jane.doe@example.com with the subject "Meeting Notes" and body "Here are the notes from today."
```

```
List my upcoming calendar events for the next 3 days.
```

```
Create a calendar event titled "Team Sync" tomorrow at 10 AM for 1 hour.
```

```
Refresh my Google OAuth tokens
```

```
Re-authenticate my Google account
```

## Transport Support

This MCP server supports both stdio and HTTP transports via environment variables:

### Stdio Transport (Default)

```bash
# Default mode - uses stdio transport
bun run dev
# Or explicitly
MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio bun run index.ts
```

### HTTP Transport (Streamable HTTP)

```bash
# HTTP mode with Streamable HTTP support
MCP_TRANSPORT=http bun run index.ts
# Or with custom port
MCP_TRANSPORT=http PORT=3000 bun run index.ts
```

When running in HTTP mode, the server provides these endpoints:

- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint with session count
- `GET /mcp` - Session info and server status
- `POST /mcp` - Main MCP JSON-RPC endpoint for sending requests
- `DELETE /mcp` - End session endpoint

### Session Management

The Streamable HTTP transport uses the official MCP SDK with automatic session management:

1. **Automatic Sessions**: The server automatically generates secure session IDs
2. **SSE Streaming**: Supports Server-Sent Events for real-time communication
3. **JSON Responses**: Falls back to JSON responses when SSE is not available
4. **DNS Protection**: Built-in security features for production deployment

### Configuration for HTTP Transport

For HTTP transport, configure your client with the server URL:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-mcp-http": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vakharwalad23/google-mcp.git
cd google-mcp
bun install

# Run in stdio mode (default)
bun run dev:stdio

# Run in HTTP mode
bun run dev:http
```
